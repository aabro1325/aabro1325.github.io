                         - Worked with Dr. Jeff Mielke, Linguistics Professor at NCSU, to annotate recordings and prepare data for research on the distinction of vowel backness in the endangered language, Bora. <br>
                         - Worked with R to help organize data for speech sounds; my work was crucial to develop trend-based analysis which determined formant changes with Raleigh corpus data <br>
                         - Reviewed and helped develop code (Python, C) for robotic tongue to move in certain positions based on anatomically accurate tongue muscle movement <br>
                         - Pursued independent research with Dr. Mielke about perception of vowels based on various formant settings

                         - Worked with PhD candidate Fahim Hasan Khan to create an image classification app used to detect speech sounds using ultrasound images of the tongue <br>
                         - This citizen science app will help linguists easily correlate spectrogram and Textgrid data with ultrasound videos of the tongue <br>
                         - Used the labelImg and tensorflow softwares to label the data and train the object detection model, respectively

                        - Founded the <a href="https://sproutingyouth.org/">Sprouting Youth Foundation</a> a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (EIN: 85-3143496) that helps kids of all ages and backgrounds learn robotics, public speaking, and youth leadership skills <br>
                        - I spent 500+ hours creating curriculums, teaching classes, marketing the programs, finding beneficiaries, conducting outreach events, building a leadership team for continued sustainability, conducting leadership meetings, training tutors, partnering with other organizations, and establishing our program in various schools across the globe.

                        - Captain, our team has advanced to the state level competition and won Think 1st, Inspire 2nd, and Motivate 1st <br>
                        - Led the design and development of our competition robot, utilizing Java for programming and algorithm development, including a custom pathfinding algorithm that leveraged motion profiling and PID control for precise navigation and responsiveness. <br>
                        - We have conducted several community outreach programs: Taught students robotics for library workshop and halloween outreach event, created armdles (arm handles for contactless door handling) for local businesses during COVID, started and mentored an FLL team, and created a platform where FTC teams across the country could collaborate on designs and organize meet
