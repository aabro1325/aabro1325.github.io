        <h4>Personal Website Project</h4>
        <p>
          This is a website I developed as part of the Hack4Impact starter kit,
          designed to provide a foundational experience in web development. The
          project has been progressing smoothly, and through this process, I've
          had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of core web
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working on this project, I revisited and strengthened my
          knowledge of HTML, focusing on creating well-structured and accessible
          content. I also honed my CSS skills, paying close attention to
          responsive design and ensuring that the site is visually appealing
          across various devices. Additionally, I refined my usage of Git for
          version control, reinforcing best practices like committing
          frequently, managing branches, and collaborating effectively. Overall,
          this project has been a great learning experience in applying the
          fundamentals while contributing to a meaningful cause.
